Millions of developers across the world host millions of projects—both open and closed source—on GitHub. We're fortunate to be able to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day, which is a responsibility we don’t take lightly. Together, we all have the exciting opportunity to make this a community we can be proud of.

Our diverse user base brings different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and ranges from people who created their first "Hello World" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our community has to offer, while maintaining a safe place for developers to do their best work.

By outlining what we think a [safe, welcoming, and productive community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) looks like at GitHub, we hope to help you understand how best to interact and collaborate on our platform in line with our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [Acceptable Use Policies](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

We encourage our community members to communicate expectations clearly, [moderate](#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you) their projects where possible, and [report](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse) any content that may violate our [policies](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service). GitHub Staff will investigate any reports of abuse, and may moderate public content on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service.

## Maintaining a strong community

The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform.  Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.

* **Be welcoming and open-minded** - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.

* **Be respectful** - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.

* **Be empathetic** - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

## What if something or someone offends you?

While some disagreements can be resolved with direct, respectful communication between community members, we understand that is not always the case. We encourage our community to contact GitHub Support through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) when they believe content or activity they’ve encountered violates our policies. However, if you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable, here are some ways GitHub enables you to take action:

* **Communicate expectations** - Maintainers can set community-specific guidelines to help users understand how to interact with their projects, for example, in a repository’s README, [CONTRIBUTING file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors), or [dedicated code of conduct](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project). You can find additional information on building communities on the [Communities](/communities) page.

* **Moderate Comments** - Users with [write-access privileges](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) for a repository can [edit, delete, or hide anyone's comments](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-disruptive-comments) on commits, pull requests, and issues. Anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. Comment authors and people with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a [comment's edit history](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment). Moderating your projects can feel like a big task if there is a lot of activity, but you can [add collaborators](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-personal-account-repository#collaborator-access-for-a-repository-owned-by-a-personal-account) to assist you in managing your community.

* **Lock Conversations**  - If a discussion in an issue, pull request, or commit gets out of hand, off topic, or violates your project’s code of conduct or GitHub’s policies, owners, collaborators, and anyone else with write access can put a temporary or permanent lock on the conversation. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations)."

* **Block Users**  - If you encounter a specific user who you would rather not engage with, you can [block the user from your personal account](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account) or [from your organization](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization).

* **Limit Interactions** - If your public project is getting unwanted attention, being trolled, spammed, or otherwise, you have the option of setting [temporary interaction limits](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository) to keep certain users from interacting with your repository. You can even set [code review limits](https://github.blog/2021-11-01-github-keeps-getting-better-for-open-source-maintainers/#preventing-drive-by-pull-request-approvals-and-requested-changes) to ensure quality contributions on your projects.

While we are passionate about empowering maintainers to moderate their own projects, please contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %} if you need additional support in dealing with a situation.

## What Happens if GitHub's Policies Are Violated?

To maintain GitHub as a safe, welcoming, and productive space for software developers, we rely on both community reports and proactive monitoring. When we’re made aware of behavior or content that violates our policies, we evaluate it based on several factors while prioritizing our core mission of being a home for all developers. Here’s how we approach policy enforcement and content moderation:

- **Code Collaboration Focus**: We prioritize code collaboration. We understand that code may have multiple uses, and we differentiate between how code is used on GitHub versus potential other applications. When enforcing policies, we strive to minimize disruptions to legitimate content while considering the complex interdependencies across the platform.

- **Human-Centered Content Moderation**: Our approach to content moderation is human-centered and tailored to each specific situation. Our global team investigates reports on a case-by-case basis, considering context and facts before taking action. This includes evaluating potentially offensive content posted without context, which could unintentionally expose users to inappropriate material. In such cases, we may choose moderation to protect the community.

- **Commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging**: Our decisions are guided by our belief that fostering an interconnected developer community and promoting human progress requires a strong commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging.

When moderation action is necessary, we may respond by:

- Removing the offending content
- Blocking or disabling the offending content
- Reducing the visibility of the offending content
- Hiding a user account or organization from public view
- Suspending a user account or organization

## Appeal and Reinstatement


If your content or account has been disabled or restricted and you seek reinstatement or wish to appeal, please see our [Appeal and Reinstatement page](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement) for information about the process and use our [Appeal and Reinstatement form](https://support.github.com/contact/reinstatement) to submit a request.
